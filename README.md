How's it goin? I'm Fernando Dias, a Front-end Developer.

Currently, I'm with JR Studio, working on cool projects like JR Studio Gamehub and JR Studio Roots. Previously, I've contributed to D3's projects like D3 MFEs Lib, Zag web admin, D3 landing website, and Comgas sales website. I've also collaborated with Dot Group on StudionMX.
Aside from my main roles, I take on freelance projects on Upwork.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next, Tailwindcss, and more.

I hold certificates in Técnico em Informática, NestJS Fundamentals, JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms, and Functional Programming in JavaScript.

Fluent in Portuguese and English, I'm open to new challenges. Connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my GitHub. Explore my work, like the Metro House Project, or watch a YouTube video.

Excited to connect and create together!
