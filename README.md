Front-end developer with 2+ years who migrated to fullstack web3 development.

I'm open to work, feel free to text me.

Besides enjoying programming a lot, I like the freedom principles so this matches my passion between programming and blockchain and their culture and lifestyle.

My stack is composed of the following technologies:  Typescript, React, Next, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vite, Thirdweb, SDKs, Alchemy, Moralis, Hardhat, Wagmi, Solidity (smart contracts), IPFS, Lens Protocol, Tanstack Query, GraphQL, etc.

Experimental projects on blockchain:

Today some of my goals are develop the MVP of a dapp built on top of Lens protocol and as NFTs Ecommerce with Shopify and Thirdweb and, use them as to create content for Youtube, and work in a cool company that is looking for the same thing as me.
