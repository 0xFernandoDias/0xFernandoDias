My name is Fernando Dias, I'm Brazilian, married, Christian and currently living in SÃ£o Paulo capital

I'm a front-end programmer and I'm migrating to fullstack web3 development
Besides enjoying programming a lot, I like conservative principles so this matches my passion between programming and blockchain.

What makes my eyes light up is the enhancement of the developer experience, I believe that a developer happy with his stack results in faster delivery of features and higher quality, so my favorite stack is composed of the following technologies: Javascript, Typescript, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vite, Tailwindcss, Windicss, Histoire, Cypress + Moralis, Solidity, Lens and The Graph

I am currently developing a web application3

I really like patterns in development, initial setups, templates, bases, especially with my stack, it helps me document.
I am also a design enthusiast and I think that no app should be created without a design system, so I also want to share with you that I am using Microsoft Web Fluent Ui as a base for my design system.

Today some of my goals are: finish my project and use it as a base to create content for Youtube, share knowledge with the Svelte + Moralis + Lens community and work in a cool company that is looking for the same thing as me.
