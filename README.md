Hey there! My name is Fernando, a Front-end Developer skilled in JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next, Tailwind, and Jest. 
I've contributed to D3's projects, such as MFEs Lib, Web App admin, Landing website, Piped gas company website, and a Hospital app. Collaborated with Dot Group on an E-learning platform and with JR Studio on a Gamehub Webapp.
Currently, I'm actively contributing to an open-source project using a React template for e-commerce.
I hold certificates in Técnico em Informática, NestJS Fundamentals, JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms, and Functional Programming in JavaScript.
I'm also pursuing the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera, covering courses like:
Introduction to Front-End Development; HTML and CSS in depth; Programming with JavaScript;  React Basics; Advanced React; Version Control; Principles of UX/UI Design.
I like to connect and create together so I'm open to new challenges. Let's connect on LinkedIn or check out my GitHub
