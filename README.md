2+ years front end developer who migrated to fullstack web3 development.

I worked for 2 companies full-time and did some freelance work as a front-end developer, D3, a digital products agency where I developed applications together with the teams and where I worked for 2 years and worked on 4 projects.
 The second was Dot, where I supported the front of an educational platform.

Besides enjoying programming a lot, I like the freedom principles so this matches my passion between programming and blockchain and their culture and lifestyle.

My stack is composed of the following technologies: Typescript, React, Next, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vite, Thirdweb, SDKs, Alchemy, Moralis, Hardhat, Wagmi, Solidity (smart contracts), IPFS, Lens Protocol, Tanstack Query, GraphQL, etc.

Today some of my goals are develop a dapp MVP built on top of Lens protocol and an NFTs e-ccommerce with Shopify and Thirdweb and, use them to create content for Youtube, and work in a cool company that is looking for the same thing as me.
