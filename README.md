My name is Fernando Dias, and I am a Front-End Developer with over 3 years of experience, holding professional certificates from Meta and IBM. I am skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Native, Tailwind CSS, and Jest.

Currently, I am working at Popcode, focusing on mobile app development. My previous experience includes working with companies such as D3, where I contributed to projects including the MFEs Lib, Admin Web App, Company’s Landing Website, Piped Gas Company Website, and a Healthcare Application. At Dot Group, I worked on a SaaS e-learning platform, and with JR Studio, I developed the Gamehub Web App.

I have also undertaken freelance projects, including developing an Admin Front for product stock management and creating an eCommerce Website, among others. In addition, I have contributed to open-source projects and developed personal projects.

I enjoy connecting with others and collaborating on innovative solutions. Let’s connect on LinkedIn or explore my work on GitHub
